## 🔨 Monkey Built

Some of my notable and favourite code:
- [my knowledge wiki](abaj.ai) - multi-disciplinary Turing complete notes powered by Emacs and org-mode.
- [tikzjax](https://github.com/abaj8494/tikzjax) - my fork of tikzjax. modified to include algorithm and UML diagram support -- the back-bone of my website
- [anki-tikz](https://github.com/abaj8494/anki-tikz) - a plugin I wrote over the course of a weekend to allow alternative $\LaTeX{}$ compilation engines in modern [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net)
- [bytelocker](http://github.com/abaj8494/bytelocker) - Neovim plugin to losslessly encrypt and decrypt regions and buffers with cipher implementations. Originally written in C, ported to Lua.
- [3-space math map](https://abaj.ai/code/math-map/docs) - Static-site built with Svelte and Three.js to visualise 48 topics of mathematics across all levels of the field. Graph structure with historical flavours.
- [shrine](https://abaj.ai/code/shrine/docs) - Pannable timeline populated with the greatest minds that lived -- their photos were ripped from Wikimedia Commons and their birth-dates are included. The project is evolving to include books, art, dinosaurs and historical eras. WIP

Some of my favourite essays:
- [Solving Peg Solitaire](https://abaj.ai/projects/csp/peg-solitaire) - Backtracking implementation to solve an old family puzzle
- [Insufficiency of Kantian Ethics for AMA](https://abaj.ai/doc/essays/kantian.pdf) - A thorough but terse essay addressing the insufficiency of Kantian / rule-based Artificial Moral Agents.
- [Value Sensitive Design of GPT3](https://abaj.ai/doc/essays/gpt3.pdf) - Human-Centered AI evaluation of the development and delivery of the indelible 'ChatGPT'
- [Perceptron](https://abaj.ai/projects/dl/perceptron/) - An explainer on the logical and historical conception of Rosenblatt's perceptron. Limitations advertised, Marvin Minsky mentioned.
- [Muli-layered Perceptron](https://abaj.ai/projects/ml/dl/mlp/) - A continuation from the limitations of the perceptron. We solve some non-trivial non-linear problems in code.

Other Refined Works:
- [Michael Nielsen's Deep Learning Book](https://abaj.ai/projects/ml/dl/feedforward/) - a thorough study of *feedforward networks*
- [Birthday Problems](https://abaj.ai/projects/bday-problems/) - An annual game played on the 26th of December.

## ☁️ Monkey Dream

These days I am learning Typescript formally and marching on with Leetcode in Python. I am also reading System Design books.
